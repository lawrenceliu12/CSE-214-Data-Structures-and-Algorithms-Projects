# CSE-214-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Projects
These are assignments and programming projects given to students that utilizes **Data Structures** using **Java**.

These assignments are by **Professor Ahmad Esmaili**, taken in **Stony Brook University**.

### Department Store
- This assignment uses a self-implemented doubly-linked list. It simulates a department store that is based by every item you add's *RFID* (Radio Frequency Identification) tag.
  
### Elevator
- This assignment is a simulator that uses a BooleanSource, which is used to create a probability of whether an event will happen. The queue, used by an LinkedList, handles elevator   request.
  
### Email
- This assignment is more of a use-whatever-you-want assignment, which you can implement whatever Data Structure you are most familiarized with. I used an ArrayList, and this assignment is coded like an email simulator. You can compose, delete, add folders and emails.

### NeoViewer
- This assignment is done by accessing NASA's given API that we had to gain access to by getting our own individual keys, and print them out. There is also an implementation where you can sort in multiple different ways.

### Playlist
- This assignment builds a playlist using an array which will record inputted songs.

### ShipLoader
- This assignment uses a stack self-implemented. It takes the image of a cargo ship that wants to push items onto the ship from the dock or take items out of ship onto the dock, in which each item has a weight of small, medium, or large.

### StorageManager
- This assignment uses Java's implemented Heap as a way to simulate a storage manager.

### Tree
- This asignment uses a binary tree that is self-implemented. It takes in a file and separates it into a readable tree. From there, you choose the options on what may seem to be the issue until they find the issue and provide you a solution, which is the end of the tree.

### Zork
- This assignment uses a binary tree that is self-implemented. It takes in a readable file and separates according to a tree. Each node has a name, option, and message. Essentially like the game, *Zork*, you keep choosing options until you reach an leaf node. You can also save the file and continue from where you left off.
